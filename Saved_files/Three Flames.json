{"title": "Three Flames", "content": "In realms of love, where hearts entwine,\nThree flames arise, with passions divine.\n\nFirst, the slow burn, a gentle start,\nTwo souls ignite, a work of art.\nWith tender touch and whispered word,\nA love so deep, forever heard.\n\nThen, compromise, a steady light,\nWhere give and take make all things right.\nIn shared decisions, paths align,\nA bond of strength, forever shine.\n\nLastly, benefits, a fleeting blaze,\nTwo hearts agree, in fleeting days.\nNo strings attached, a simple plea,\nTo satisfy desires, and then be free.", "short_summary": "poem about three types of couples, couple of slow burn, couple of compromise and couple of benifits"}
