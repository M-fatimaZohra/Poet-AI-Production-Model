{"title": "Hope and Fear", "content": "In hearts of mortals, dreams reside,\nOf realms beyond where souls abide.\nA heaven bright, a hellfire's gleam,\nWoven from hope and shadowed dream.\n\nFor those who suffer, yearn, and grieve,\nA heaven's solace to believe,\nWhere justice reigns, and peace untold,\nA sanctuary for hearts grown old.\n\nYet fear's dark tendrils twist and bind,\nA hell for deeds of cruelest kind,\nWhere retribution waits in fire,\nA consequence of dark desire.\n\nSo heaven's grace and hell's despair,\nReflect the burdens that we bear,\nA longing for a world made right,\nAnd shadows banished from the light.", "short_summary": "poetry about why people wish that there should be heaven and hell"}
